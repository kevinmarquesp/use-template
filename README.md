# `create-new-template`

A small and simple command line tool to clone GitHub repositories and use them as template. When you choose a repo, you can choose which branch you want to use as a template. So you can create a single repository for all your project templates and import these with this app.

The script will clone the chosen repo with your project name, delete the `.git/` directory (run a custom command if you want to) and run `git init` again to generate your new project.


### Usefull Node packages used to build this app
